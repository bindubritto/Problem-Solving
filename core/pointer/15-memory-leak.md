# Memory Leak

Any memory from heap which is not referenced by anyone is called garbage. In JAVA & C#, this garbage will automatically cleared from heap. But in C or C++, programmers need to free or clear that garbage explicitely. Which is very important. Cause, if we create garbage, we'll run out of memory very soon. And memory itself a very crutial resource for computing.

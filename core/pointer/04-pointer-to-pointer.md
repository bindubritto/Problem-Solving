# Pointer to Pointer

```cpp
int a; // integer a
int* p; // pointer to an integer
int** q; // pointer to pointer to an integer
int*** r; // pointer to pointer to pointer to an integer
```

We need a pointer to integer variable to store the memory address of an integer. And we need a pointer to pointer to integer to store the memory of an pointer to integer variable. We can also derefernce using this technique. And this is interesting because, we can reach to the actual varible by this dereference chain.

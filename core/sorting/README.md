# Sorting Algorithms

Sorting is arranging the elements in a list or collection in increasing or decreasing order of some property.

Sorted data is not only useful for presentation, it also good for computation.

If we have an unsorted data of 2^64 in size, then we need huge time to find a specific value from that data.

- Unsorted Data -> Linear Search -> 2^64 comparison

- Sorted Data -> Binary Search -> 64 comparison

We can classify sorting algorithms by different parameter, such as

1. Time Complexity
2. Space Complexity or Memory usage (In place or use extra memory)
3. Stability (if the key is equal then which element comes first in the original list, will come first in the sorted list too)
4. Internal vs External Sort
5. Recursive or Non-recursive
